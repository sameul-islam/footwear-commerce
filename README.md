# About Footwear-commerce

## summary :

This project is a comprehensive React-based e-commerce website, built entirely using my own unique ideas and design. It serves as a personal mega project where I aim to implement every possible JavaScript logic I have learned so far. I am fully committed to investing the time required to make this project exceptionally clean and professional.

Originally planned on December 10, 2025, I began drafting the website structure in my notebook, and the actual development started on December 16, 2025. This project focuses on a shoe e-commerce platform, incorporating as many features as possible for a complete online shopping experience. Both the design and development are entirely my own work, and I intend to extend it with backend integration in the future to make it business-ready.
