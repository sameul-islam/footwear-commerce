# About Footwear-commerce

## summary :

This project is a comprehensive React-based e-commerce website, built entirely using my own unique ideas and design. It serves as a personal mega project where I aim to implement every possible JavaScript logic I have learned so far. I am fully committed to investing the time required to make this project exceptionally clean and professional.

Originally planned on December 10, 2025, I began drafting the website structure in my notebook, and the actual development started on December 16, 2025. This project focuses on a shoe e-commerce platform, incorporating as many features as possible for a complete online shopping experience. Both the design and development are entirely my own work, and I intend to extend it with backend integration in the future to make it business-ready.

Completed the desktop dropdown menus and fully finalized the navigation bar functionality. Additionally, planned the mobile navigation experience to ensure responsive behavior across devices.

### Day 3 – December 18, 2025

Worked on the mobile navigation drawer, completing its basic structure. Although some polishing and advanced logic implementation remained pending, significant effort was put in. Focused on learning and applying React props effectively. It was a challenging day, requiring deep concentration and persistence.

I also crafted a very elegant structure for the homepage. Previously, the elements I had created felt somewhat cluttered, but today I gave them space, creating a clean and organized layout. As a result, the website now looks exceptionally polished, and its overall visual appeal has significantly increased.
